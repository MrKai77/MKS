# MKSTE
> Mechanical Keyboard Simulator: Thoccy Edition  

This is a fork of [MKS](https://github.com/x0054/MKS), which is a app that added Cherry MX Blue sound effects when typing on your keyboard. However, like some of you, I prefer thoccy keyboard sounds, which is why I made this fork. It replaces all the profiles with NK Cream switch sounds, and removes all the other unneeded features, such as the mouse clicks.

## Installation

1. Download the [MKSTE.zip](https://github.com/MrKai77/MKS/releases/latest) from the releases tab above.
1. Open the MKS.zip and drag MKS app to the Application folder in Finder.
1. Grant Accessibility permissions (see below).

### Grant Accessibility permissions

1. To work the app needs Accessibilities permissions. To give the app permissions:
   
1. Open `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`.
   1. Click on the Padlock in the bottom left hand corner.
   1. Drag the MKS app into the list. Thatâ€™s all.
   
1. Now start MKS. It will add an icon to the System Bar. Play with the options and Enjoy!
