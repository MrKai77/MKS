> Mechanical Keyboard Simulator: Thoccy Edition

This is a fork of [MKS](https://github.com/x0054/MKS), which is a app that added Cherry MX Blue sound effects when typing on your keyboard. However, like some of you, I prefer thoccy keyboard sounds, which is why I made this fork. It replaces all the profiles with NK Cream switch sounds, and removes all the other not-needed features, such as the mouse clicks.

## Installation

1. Download the [MKSTE.zip](https://github.com/MrKai77/MKS/releases/latest) from the releases tab above.
1. Open the MKS.zip and drag MKS app to the Application folder in Finder.
1. Grant Accessibility permissions (see below).

### Grant Accessibility permissions

1. To work the app needs Accessibilities permissions. To give the app permissions:
   
1. Open `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`.
   1. Click on the Padlock in the bottom left hand corner.
   1. Drag the MKS app into the list. That’s all.
   
1. Now start MKS. It will add an icon to the System Bar. Play with the options and Enjoy!
